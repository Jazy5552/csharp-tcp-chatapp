This is a simple C# server and client app(s). This is one of my first C# apps and also one of my first networking/sockets related apps.

The solution is composed of 2 apps/projects. One is a client, and the other is a server. They work as you would expect a client and server to work.

The purpose of this project was mostly to learn c# and networking/sockets.
